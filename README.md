# A Visual Odometry Pipeline
A simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two frames, pose estimation using established 2D - 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new landmarks.

## How to run
1. Extract the dataset, e.g. kitti05.zip, into the folder `data`
2. Run `main.py`
